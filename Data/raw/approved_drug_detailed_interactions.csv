Prior to full approval in 2012, the EMA had designated ivacaftor as an orphan medicine for rare diseases in 2008. In December 2014, FDA approval was expanded to include patients with CFTR mutations, including R117H. In late March 2015, FDA approval was expanded to include the treatment of children aged 2-5 carrying any one of 10 different CFTR mutations (G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R and R117H).<br>In July 2015, a fixed-dose combination of ivacaftor plus <Ligand id=7481/> (Orkambi&reg;) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 12 years and older carrying the F508del mutation. FDA approval for Orkambi&reg; was expanded in October 2016 to include children with cystic fibrosis aged 6 to 11 who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. In May 2017, use of ivacaftor was approved for use in a number of rare and previously excluded CFTR mutations, bringing the total number of mutations covered to 33.","","CFTR","707","1080","ENSG00000001626","CFTR",,"0","Human"

This highlights the necessity that drug compounds be steroespecifically pure when there is a pharmacological difference in activity between stereoisomers (<i>ie</i> they exhibit distinct molecular mechanisms of action), as enantiomerically impure mixtures may result in off-target effects.<br>A number of chemical suppliers and other submitters to online chemistry databases specify the non-stereoisomeric molecule depicted in <a href=""https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=11597571"">PubChem CID 11597571</a>.","ALK receptor tyrosine kinase","1839","238","ENSG00000171094","ALK",,"0","Human"

An inhalation solution of arbekacin (ME1100) is being developed for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.  <br><br>Several aminoglycoside antibacterials, including arbekacin, have been reported to have the ability to promote mRNA translation even in the presence of premature termination codons (PTCs) in mutated genes. In the absence of pharmaceutical intervention, the ribosomal translation process produces truncated, often non-functional protein products. However, in the presence of such compounds the ribosomes 'readthrough' the PTCs, producing increased amounts of full-length, functional protein. This developing pharmaceutical intervention has been termed 'readthrough strategy' and has led to a repurposing effort, with the compound now being evaluated in clinical trial as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), in patients where the inherited genetic mutation causes production of truncated, non-functional dystrophin. Dystrophin is a protein critical for muscle function.

Later in May 2017, accelerated approval was granted for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors (notably in <u>any tissue</u>) that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, or with MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, <Ligand id=7433/>, and <Ligand id=6823/>. Accelerated approval for PD-L1 +ve recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or cancer of the gastroesophageal junction was granted by the FDA in September 2017. <br><br>June 2018 brought two more FDA approvals for pembrolizumab: as a treatment for relapsed (after two or more prior therapies) or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) <Reference id=35228/> (see KEYNOTE‑170  trial <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02576990"" target=""_blank"">NCT02576990</a>), and as the first anti-PD-1 therapy for advanced cervical cancer (in patients with recurrent or metastatic PD-1 +ve cervical cancer that  progressed on or after chemotherapy; see KEYNOTE-158 trial <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02628067"" target=""_blank"">NCT02628067</a>). In August 2018 the FDA granted regular approval for the use of pembrolizumab (in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-containing chemotherapy) as a first-line treatment for metastatic, non-squamous NSCLCs that have no EGFR or ALK genomic alterations. October 2018 saw a further expansion in approval for a combination therapy containing pembrolizumab, carboplatin and <Ligand id=2770/> or nab-paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC (based on results from the KEYNOTE-407 trial <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02775435?term=NCT02775435"" target=""_blank"">NCT02775435</a>) <Reference id=36326/>. FDA approval for use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and previously treated with <Ligand id=5711/> was granted in November 2018.<br><br>April 2019 saw FDA approval for pembrolizumab plus <Ligand id=5659/> as a first-line therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), based on results from the KEYNOTE‑426 trial (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02853331"" target=""_blank"">NCT02853331</a>) <Reference id=37655/><Reference id=37654/>. Approval was further expanded in June 2019 as a first-line option for metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, that can be used either as a single agent or in combination with a platinum-based chemotherapeutic and fluorouracil (see KEYNOTE-048  trial <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02358031"" target=""_blank"">NCT02358031</a> <Reference id=37828/>).

Because romosozumab therapy is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death it must not be prescribed for patients who have suffered a heart attack or stroke within the previous 12 months. The bone forming effects of romosozumab diminish following 12 monthly doses, at which point patients should be moved on to osteoporosis treatments that reduce bone loss if continuing therapy is required.","",,"0",,,,"sclerostin","3704","Human"

Futility analysis (<i>i.e.</i> concluding that the antibody would not delay cognitive decline) led to the decision by aducanumab's developer Biogen, to terminate these trials but to complete patient follow-ups and closing out activities. Although designed as a duplicate of EMERGE, ENGAGE failed to replicate the efficacy seen in EMERGE.  Following anaysis of the larger dataset collected from all of the patients from both trials who completed 18 months follow up, Biogen claimed that extended exposure to the higher 10 mg/kg dose used in their trials was effective <Reference id=42168/>, and they declared their intention to seek FDA approval for this treatment regimen in early 2020 <Reference id=38510/>. Biogen's claims about aducanumab's efficacy have been highly scrutinised (and criticised) <Reference id=38509/><Reference id=38515/><Reference id=42167/>. Despite ambiguous data with no clear demonstration of clinical benefit, and the adverse events ascribed to aducanumab therapy (cerebral oedema), it is clear that a well designed and powered confirmatory RCTs are essential.   Despite the lack of evidence of efficacy, the FDA accepted Biogen's regulatory submission for adacanumab in August 2020, and granted priority review, with a planned decision date of early March 2021. In fact it took until June 2021 for the FDA's decision to grant accelerated approval for adacanumab as a treatment for AD to be announced. Continued approval for this indication will depend on verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).

Although Phase 1 safety results have not yet been published, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics have announced <i>via</i> press release (June 19, 2020) that EIDD-2801 is safe in humans at predicted therapeutic doses. At this time Ridgeback advised that they would launch two Phase 2 clinical trials in recently symptomatic, newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients (separate trials for newly hospitalised and newly diagnosed non-hospitalised patient groups) <Reference id=39831/>. These studies recruited participants in the US and in the UK. In April 2021, Merck announced that they were discontinuing development of molnupiravir in hospitalised patients after a predicted lack of efficacy became evident from the clinical trial. In contrast a company press release from Merck on 1st October 2021 <Reference id=43001/>, revealed that so significant was the clinical benefit of molnupiravir in at-risk, non-hospitalized adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the FDA Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended stopping the trial early, viewing it unethical to proceed. At a planned interim analysis of data collected from an initial set of >750 participants (recruited between May and early August), molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by ~50% in patients with confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcome (on a regimen of 4 tablets of drug or placebo, twice daily for 5 consecutive days). However, treatment in a subsequent cohort of ~650 participants (recruited between August and early October) was found to be less effective than previously thought. In response to the original efficacy data, Ridgeback/Merck proceeded to submit applications for approval to various national drug regulatory agencies. Molnupiravir's first approval was issued by the UK's MHRA on 4th Nov. 2021, as a treatment for recently diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-hospitalised individuals who have at least one risk factor for developing severe illness <Reference id=43563/>. The US FDA recommended molnupiravir for EUA in late November 2021. Approvals by other national regulatory agencies are pending.","The active form of EIDD-2801 exists in two tautomeric states, one which is a uridine mimic (pairs with adenosine), and the second which mimics cytidine (pairs with guanosine) <Reference id=39005/>. During RNA replication switching between these tautomers causes mismatches and leads to catastrophic mutation within the new viral RNA transcripts which render it non-functional. <Ligand id=10715/> is another nucleoside analogue that is being evaluated in human trials for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The active forms of both compounds block viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to prevent virus replication, but in slightly different ways, suggesting that their effects may be complementary.  Another difference between remdesivir and EIDD-2801 is that while remdesivir needs to be administered intravenously within a medical setting, EIDD-2801 is orally bioavailable, so could be taken at home. This offers the potential for treatment to be initiated earlier in the course of the disease, before more severe symptoms develop.",,"0",,,,,"0",
